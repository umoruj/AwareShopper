# AwareShopper
Aware Shopper mobile app in Swift
The Aware Shopper app as the name implies endeavors to keep the user abreast with latest products available on discount within the confines of the shop the user enters. The Aware Shopper app detects the iBeacon-compatible hardware transmitters or Estimote beacon and identifies its location form the UUID, Major and Minor id supplied from the signal. The data from the iBeacon is used to make a request to the database for the data specific to that shop and then displayed to the user within app. And it is further analyzed into the various categories for easy identification. 
To access the project from xcode used the AwareShpperv2.xcworkspace file
